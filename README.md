## About This Project

This project was my first attempt at building a C++ application and explores:

- Client–server networking using Boost.Asio
- Real-time game state synchronization
- SDL-based rendering and input handling
- Custom serialization logic for gameplay events

As such, the architecture and code quality reflect an early stage in my C++ learning.
